 <h1>Coding in Nagaland</h1>
  <p>Coding is something new to our Naga society and is not that common. But I can't denied the fact that there will be someone out there who are pro-coders.                                                                                                So, this is my attempt on making and building a community for the coders in our place. we can help and show our abilities to  each other. </p>
<p>Coding sometime can be frustracting and sometime rewarding but we must have COMPANION to share our idea and skill to keep the journey alive.                                                                                                                  Hence I'm trying to  built a common platform do keep our coding alive and draw new coders.</p>
